# INTRO
This is the Knights Max Flow problem. You try to find a good placement of "Knight's move" (kt-move)edges connecting pairs of grid cells into a flow graph. Each placed edge's flow capacity depends on the grid cells it connects. In effect, you construct the best graph you can on top of the grid.
